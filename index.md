Section B11 - Alex Cloninger and Rayan Saab

1. **What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
   My domain is already very specific, as it deals with diffusion models. Within diffusion models, besides learning about how they work, the most interesting topic was getting to play around with and visualizing how points move during the diffusion process, and how different hyperparameters affect how the diffusion model works. 
2. **Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
   A potential investigation I'd like to pursue for my Quarter 2 Project is image inpainting with diffusion models. 
3. **What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
   A potential change I'd make is having more structure in the teamwork, and having more consistent scheduled times to meet and discuss work.
4. **What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
   I'm also interested in text-to-image, so using NLU in order to generate images from a text prompt. This could be related to inpainting, for example, in telling the model to remove a certain object from an image.
